# anvitaguptaa.github.io

My personal website, built with Jekyll and powered by GitHub Pages.

## Local development
### Installations:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```sh
brew install node
```

If you need to switch between Node versions regurlarly, I would recommend to install Node via [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md#manual-install).

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

```sh
gem install bundler jekyll
```

For more information, refer to [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

Dependencies:
```sh
yarn
bundle install
```

### Usage

* Run and develop locally with live server at `http://localhost:4000` which will build production-ready `JS` and `SCSS` assets with every change

```sh
gulp
```
